<strong>Who we are?</strong>
<p>We are a group of enthusiasts who have decided to create their own NFT Tokens.</p>
<p></p>
<strong>Why our NFT is better than others?</strong>
<p>Our tokens in collections <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/scary-me">"Scary Me" </a> , <a href="https://ynotnft.azurewebsites.net/error">"CyprusThroughGlass" </a> , <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/pixels-companies">"Pixels & Companies" </a> - just collections drawn by creative people , but we also have special collections: <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/pixels-monopoly">"Pixels & Monopoly" </a> , <a href="https://opensea.io/collection/pixels-and-sportsmans">"Pixels & Sportsman's" </a> & <a href="https://ynotnft.azurewebsites.net/error">"RetroCars" </a> - those collections are future part of metaverse which is in developing process right now and very soon tokens you own from our collections will be a part of a big metaverse.</p>
<strong>What NFT Metaverse is?</strong>
<p>The metaverse is an immersive virtual world, where users have their own avatar and can interact with each other, share experiences and create places and objects similar to real life. A metaverse is likely to build a completely new ecosystem, a massive-multiplayer online game if you will, with an incorporated economy, that enables users to buy and sell items.

<strong>What NFT is?</strong>
<p>NFT stands for a non-fungible token, which means it can neither be replaced nor interchanged because it has unique properties. Digital Asset - NFT is a digital asset that represents internet collectibles like art, music, and games with an authentic certificate created by blockchain technology that underlies Cryptocurrency. Unique - It cannot be forged or otherwise manipulated. Exchange - NFT exchanges take place in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin on specialist sites.
