<strong>Who we are?</strong>

<strong>What NFT Metaverse is?</strong>
<p>The metaverse is an immersive virtual world, where users have their own avatar and can interact with each other, share experiences and create places and objects similar to real life. A metaverse is likely to build a completely new ecosystem, a massive-multiplayer online game if you will, with an incorporated economy, that enables users to buy and sell items.

<strong>What NFT is?</strong>
<p>NFT stands for a non-fungible token, which means it can neither be replaced nor interchanged because it has unique properties. Digital Asset - NFT is a digital asset that represents internet collectibles like art, music, and games with an authentic certificate created by blockchain technology that underlies Cryptocurrency. Unique - It cannot be forged or otherwise manipulated. Exchange - NFT exchanges take place in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin on specialist sites.
